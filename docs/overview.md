## Studio 24 · Product Overview

### Mission
Help solo creators, micro-agencies, and growth teams publish professional, multi-channel campaigns every week without hiring a full production staff. Studio 24 turns one idea into AI-authored copy, branded visuals, automated scheduling, and performance insights—packaged as a service customers are willing to pay for.

### Vision
Become the automation backbone for creator-led businesses: a control center that connects ideation, production, scheduling, and analytics through best-in-class AI and workflow tooling (Gemini, Canva, n8n, Remotion Worker, and social APIs). We win when users ship more revenue-generating content in less time.

### Target Personas
| Persona | Primary Goal | Pain Today | Studio 24 Promise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Independent Creator** (YouTube/TikTok/Podcast) | Publish 4–7 high-quality posts per week across 3+ channels | Spends nights cutting clips, rewriting captions, tracking analytics manually | Auto-produce scripts/clips/captions, approve in a single UI, post on schedule |
| **Boutique Social Agency** (≤10 clients) | Deliver client calendars with measurable results | Tool sprawl, inconsistent quality, duplication of effort | Reusable workflows, brand libraries, client-ready reports, automated approvals |
| **Growth Lead / SMB Marketer** | Drive pipeline with social + newsletter workflow | Lacks dedicated content team, inconsistent output | Guided playbooks, AI-drafted assets, scheduled distribution, ROI insights |

### Jobs To Be Done
1. **Ideate**: “When I’m staring at a blank page, give me campaign concepts tailored to my audience and offer.”
2. **Produce**: “When I approve a concept, turn it into copy, images/video, and assets ready for editing.”
3. **Schedule**: “When assets are final, push them to all relevant platforms automatically with the right formatting and hashtags.”
4. **Measure**: “When campaigns go live, pull metrics and surface what to double-down on next.”
5. **Collaborate**: “When I work with clients or teammates, keep feedback, approvals, and billing seamless.”

### Product Pillars
1. **AI Creative Engine (Gemini)** – On-brand copywriting, hooks, scripts, outlines, and repurposed clips generated from structured prompts.
2. **Visual Assembly (Canva + Remotion Worker)** – Canva template handoffs and Remotion-powered media automation for consistent on-brand assets.
3. **Automation Orchestration (n8n)** – Workflow layer that coordinates content creation, scheduling, publishing, analytics, and notifications.
4. **Insight Loop** – Unified analytics dashboards, growth scoring, and recommendations that feed back into new campaigns.
5. **Monetization Framework** – Pricing and usage limits aligned with automation cost drivers, built for conversion and high margins.

### Flagship Experiences
- **Campaign Launchpad**: Guided wizard that captures audience, offer, and platforms → spins up Gemini prompts, n8n workflows, Canva templates, and a proposed schedule.
- **Automation Cockpit**: Dashboard with live n8n workflow runs, retry controls, approval gates, and status across each social channel.
- **Content Calendar**: Kanban + calendar hybrid highlighting drafts, scheduled posts, approvals, and performance; supports drag-and-drop rescheduling.
- **Analytics Insight Hub**: Cross-platform metrics, trend analysis, and recommended next actions; exportable client reports.
- **Billing & Seats**: Stripe-powered plan management with workspace seats, add-ons, and automatic usage metering.

### Competitive Differentiators
- **Automation First**: n8n and Remotion Worker orchestrate production-to-publish workflows; users aren’t stuck exporting files manually.
- **Creator-Grade Output**: Gemini prompts, Canva templates, and speech-aware video clipping tuned specifically for creator verticals.
- **All-In Pricing**: USD-denominated plans with predictable automation quotas and optional add-ons for agencies.
- **Sellable Service**: Client-facing reports, approvals, and white-label exports position Studio 24 as an agency tool, not a hobby app.

### Operating Principles
1. **Architect for Revenue** – Every feature ties back to billable outcomes (more content shipped, better analytics, agency-grade deliverables).
2. **Automate or Remove** – Manual steps (copy/paste, scheduling, reporting) are replaced with n8n flows or culled.
3. **Document before Build** – Changes to strategy, workflows, or stack start in these docs to keep Cursor and humans aligned.
4. **Free Resources First** – Prefer free tiers or self-hosted options for APIs/automation; log cost trade-offs explicitly.
5. **Compliance by Design** – Respect platform policies (OAuth, rate limits, content guidelines) to avoid account bans.

### Strategic Roadmap Themes
- **Launch**: Deliver a polished MVP with automation-heavy differentiators and a premium experience.
- **Scale**: Introduce marketplace integrations (Notion, Webflow, Shopify), deeper analytics, and agency collaboration tools.
- **Monetize**: Expand add-ons (paid automation packs, white-label reporting, concierge services) and partnerships.
