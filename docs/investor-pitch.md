# Studio 24 · Investor Pitch

## 1. Vision
Studio 24 becomes the premium AI studio of record for creators, agencies, and growth teams that need polished multi-platform content—without hiring expensive editors or switching between tools. Our promise: **“Idea in → campaign-ready assets out in minutes.”**

## 2. Problem
- Creators and agencies juggle ideation (ChatGPT), scripting (Docs), design (Canva), video edits (Premiere), and publishing tools.
- Traditional AI copy tools stop at text. Automated video tools struggle with branding, speaker focus, and export quality.
- Agencies lose margin to manual editing; creators lose momentum and consistency.

## 3. Solution
Studio 24 unifies the entire workflow inside a SaaS platform:
1. **Instant Creative Engine** – Gemini-powered hooks, scripts, captions tuned to brand and channel.
2. **Video Repurpose Suite** – YouTube transcript → shorts playbooks, teaser scripts, caption packs.
3. **Storyboard Studio** – Structured scene plans with one-click Canva handoffs.
4. **Auto Reels Renderer** – YouTube link → multiple downloadable reels with speaker-aware framing, animated overlays, captions, and thumbnails (Premium).

All surfaced through a frictionless Next.js SaaS deployed on Vercel, with Supabase for persistence, Stripe for billing, and Shotstack-style rendering for premium exports.

## 4. Product Snapshot
- **Launch Target:** MVP in 24 hours (24-hour hackathon heritage) refined into a premium USD offering.
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js App Router, Supabase, Stripe, Gemini, Canva template bridge, managed rendering API.
- **Distribution:** Web-first, responsive across devices, no native app dependency.

## 5. Market Opportunity
- >50M global professional creators and micro agencies (Goldman Sachs).
- Social video spend projected to reach $184B by 2027 (Statista).
- Paid productivity tooling for creators growing 30% YoY; willingness to pay $99–$299/mo for time-saving automation.
- Early focus: US/Canada agencies & serious creators paying in USD.

## 6. Business Model
- **Free Plan:** 10 AI generations/day, Text Studio access, previews for premium features.
- **Premium Plan (USD $149/mo target):** Unlimited AI runs, Auto Reels downloads, Canva handoffs, saved projects, brand presets.
- **Future Monetization:** Team workspaces, template marketplace, AI post scheduling, analytics dashboards, bespoke agency add-ons.

## 7. Competitive Landscape
| Product | Strength | Gap Studio 24 Fills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jasper.ai | Long-form marketing copy | No video automation, no Canva handoff |
| Pictory.ai | Video repurposing | Lacks multi-channel copy + premium design bridge |
| Opus Clip / Captions.ai | Quick reel remixes | Limited brand control, single output, no campaign view |
| Copy.ai | Marketing copy | Text-only, not social-native |

**Studio 24 Advantage:** Full-stack orchestration (text + storyboard + design + downloadable reels) with premium UX and high-margin API economics.

## 8. Traction & Roadmap

- **Phase 6 (Q1 2026):** Auto Reels Rendering (speaker diarization, downloadable MP4s).
- **Phase 7+:** Dashboard revamp, analytics, template marketplace, social scheduling integrations.

## 9. Go-To-Market
- **Beachhead:** Boutique agencies managing 5–15 clients and premium creators posting daily.
- **Channels:** Founder-led sales, community partnerships (creator collectives), paid retargeting (ARPU justifies CAC), referral incentives.
- **Content Strategy:** “From idea to download in minutes” case studies, teardown videos, influencer co-marketing.
- **Land & Expand:** Offer agency add-ons (white-label exports, team seats) and brand library upgrades.

## 10. Financial Plan (Model Snapshot)
- **Price:** $149/mo Premium (intro); volume discounts for agencies.

## 12. Moat
