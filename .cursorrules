# Cursor Project Guidelines

## Required Context Files

- `docs/overview.md`
- `docs/architecture-summary.md`
- `docs/detailed-architecture.md`
- `docs/environment.md`
- `docs/implementation-roadmap.md`
- `docs/development-playbook.md`
- `docs/limits-and-plans.md`
- `docs/canva.md`
- `docs/gemini.md`
- `docs/n8n.md`
- `docs/remotion.md`
- `docs/social-platforms.md`

## Before Making Changes

1. Refresh product goals in `docs/overview.md`.
2. Confirm architecture & flows with `docs/architecture-summary.md` and `docs/detailed-architecture.md`.
3. Review implementation conventions in `docs/development-playbook.md`.
4. Consult integration specifics (Canva, Gemini, n8n, Remotion Worker, social platforms) as needed.

## Editing Principles

- Keep docs as the source of truth—update them before shipping code.
- Align implementation with roadmap phases in `docs/implementation-roadmap.md`.
- Honour plan/limit rules defined in `docs/limits-and-plans.md`.
- Prefer adjustments to documentation when project direction changes.
