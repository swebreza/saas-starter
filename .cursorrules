# Cursor Project Guidelines

## Required Context Files
- `docs/overview.md`
- `docs/architecture-summary.md`
- `docs/development-playbook.md`
- `docs/implementation-roadmap.md`
- `docs/Hackathon.md`

## Before Making Changes
1. Read or refresh the current goal from `docs/overview.md`.
2. Confirm architectural or flow details with `docs/architecture-summary.md`.
3. Review implementation conventions in `docs/development-playbook.md`.
4. If deeper context is needed, reference `docs/Hackathon.md`.

## Editing Principles
- Align all modifications with the scope and assumptions documented above.
- Avoid implementing features or flows that contradict these references.
- Prefer updating these docs first if project direction changes.
